Action Queue Trigger modding how-to

Trigger parses new log events from the game logs, matching them against all configured conditions.
After each bunch of events, it will make a decision whether action was started or finished. 
Based on that, it schedules notifications.


There are following types of checks (Condition Types), that can be adjusted:

ActionStart -  
	flags the log event as starting an in-game action 
	NOTE: Every time ActionStart is found, it resets the script, eg. resets notification schedule.
ActionFalstart - 
	checked after ActionStart, if matched, will override ActionStart (event is not seen as starting action)

ActionEnd - 
	flags the log event as ending an in-game action, notification is scheduled with configured delay
ActionFalsEnd - 
	checked after ActionEnd, if matched, will override ActionEnd (event is not seen as ending any action)

ActionFalsEndPreviousEvent - 
	this works similar to ActionFalsEnd, except it looks at an event logged right before current one

LevelingStart - 
	this is a special condition, that checks for Leveling action start (both surface and underground).
	NOTE: Leveling is handled a bit differently, due to it's channeled nature, but this condition purpose is similar ActionStart

LevelingEnd - 
	decides if leveling has been finished, purpose similar to ActionEnd


Additionally, there are 3 types of string matching strategies. These decide, how to to treat content of the wurm log entry:

StartsWithCaseSensitiveOrdinal -
	checks if the log event content starts with the pattern, is case sensitive and uses ordinal string matching
	NOTE: log events do not include timestamp and source, 
	eg event: 
		[12:34:56] <Abc> You do something special.
	is seen as: 
		You do something special.

ContainsCaseSensitiveOrdinal -
	checks if the log event content contains the pattern, is case sensitive and uses ordinal string matching

RegexDefaultOptions -
	very flexible condition, checks if the log event content matches a Regular Expression pattern,
	pattern is matched using default C# .NET options,
	NOTE: regex checks, especially complex ones, are slow and should not be overused


Final notes:
-	Conditions marked with "default" should not be deleted, but disabled instead. 
	If deleted, they will be readded on next app start, with default options.
	They can be edited, changes will not be overwritten.
-	All conditions can be exported to a CSV text file, and openen in excel for easier analysis.
	There is no import option.
