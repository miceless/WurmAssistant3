## Introduction
#
# use this file to add or disable certain events from triggering queue sound
# every event is evaluated separately by Sound Notify and events are already stripped of timestamp
# example lines as they are processed by Sound Notify:
#
# You start to push the oven.
# You stop pushing.
# 
# This file will extend hardcoded list of events. You can use it to add new conditions and disable existing ones.
# For the list of current conditions check the LogQueueParseHelper.cs under this link:
# https://github.com/PeterAldur/WurmAssistant2/blob/master/WurmAssistant2/Modules/SoundNotify/Notifier/LogQueueParseHelper.cs
#
## Modding HOW-TO
#
# Simply add a sentence under one of the groups below, one sentence per line.
# Sentence should contain text from single log event and is CASE SENSITIVE!
# examples:
# 
# +ACTION_START
# You begin reading Old Dusty Tome of Engineering
#
# +ACTION_START_CONTAINS
# creating I-win button
# 
# +ACTION_END_CONTAINS
# created I-lose button instead
# 
#
# If you want to disable a certain hardcoded sentence, prefix it with =DISABLE
# example:
#
# +ACTION_FALSEND
# =DISABLE A high guard tower
# =DISABLE A tool for
#
#
# You will need to restart wurm assistant for these changes to take effect
#
##


# if an event starts with these, it informs Sound Notify that action has started
+ACTION_START

# below is analogous to ACTION_START, 
# with the exception that it searches for this sentence in entire event line
# and not just at the beginning
+ACTION_START_CONTAINS

# if an event starts with these, it informs Sound Notify this is actually not start of an action
+ACTION_FALSTART

# if an event starts with these, it informs Sound Notify that action has finished 
+ACTION_END

# below is analogous to ACTION_END, 
# with the exception that it searches for this sentence in entire event line
# and not just at the beginning
+ACTION_END_CONTAINS

# if an event starts with these, it informs Sound Notify this is actually not an end of action
+ACTION_FALSEND

# this is analogous to ActionFalsEnd, with the exception that
# these will be checked against previous log line parsed by Sound Notify
+ACTION_FALSEND_LAST_EVENT
